/** @file triangle.h
 *
 * Triangle Synth
 *
 * This produces a triangle wave, which corresponds to:
 *
 * @verbatim

inf   cos(nwt) - cos(nw(t + skew))
 Î£  - ----------------------------
n=1                2
                  n
@endverbatim
 *
 * When @c skew is 0.5, the default, this produces a true triangle
 * wave.  Other values of @c skew will produce waveforms with the peak
 * of the triangle offset to one side of the wave, with a sawtooth
 * wave as the limit.
 *
 * If the @c scale parameter is set, the (bandlimited) amplitude of
 * the wave will be decreased such that the peak is always under 1.0.
 * This is probably not what you want unless you are using a constant
 * frequency value.  Also, this is extremely approximate; the peak
 * value should always be under 1.0, but it will not necessarily reach
 * 1.0 for all values of @c skew.
