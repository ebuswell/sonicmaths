 * Impulse Train Synth

 * This produces an impulse train, which corresponds to:

 * @verbatim
inf
 Î£ cos(nwt)
n=1
@endverbatim
 *
 * If the @c scale parameter is set, the (bandlimited) amplitude of the wave
 * will be decreased such that the peak is always under 1.0. This is probably
 * not what you want unless you are using a constant frequency value.
