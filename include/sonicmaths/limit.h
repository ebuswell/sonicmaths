 * Limiter filter
 *
 * Limits ("distorts") input according to one of the following equations,
 * where s is @c sharpness, g is @c gain, and x is the original input.
 *
 * Lower values of @c sharpness make the sound less "warm" and vice versa.
 *
 * For <tt>Exponential</tt>:
 *
 * @verbatim
         -s(gx - 1)
    log(e           + 1)
1 - --------------------
            -s
       log(e   + 1)
@endverbatim
 *
 * With a symmetrical equation for a negative x.
 *
 * For <tt>Hyperbolic</tt>:
 *
 * @verbatim
      gx
--------------
     s     1/s
(|gx|  + 1)
@endverbatim
 *
 * For <tt>Arctangent</tt>:
