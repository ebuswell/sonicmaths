/** @file square.h
 *
 * Square Synth
 *
 * This produces a square wave, which corresponds to:
 *
 * @verbatim
inf sin(nwt) - sin(nw(t + skew))
 Î£  ----------------------------
n=1             n
@endverbatim
 *
 * When @c skew is 0.5, the default, this produces a true square wave.
 * Other values of @c skew will produce different ratios between upper
 * and lower values, that is, different duty cycles, with an impulse
 * train as the limit.
 *
 * If the @c scale parameter is set, the (bandlimited) amplitude of
 * the wave will be decreased such that the peak is always under 1.0.
 * This is probably not what you want unless you are using a constant
 * frequency value.  Also, this is extremely approximate; the peak
 * value should always be under 1.0, but it will not necessarily reach
 * 1.0 for all values of @c skew.
