 * This produces a parabola wave, which corresponds to:
 *
 * @verbatim

inf -cos(nwt)
 Î£  ---------
n=1      2
        n
@endverbatim
 *
 * If the @c scale parameter is set, the (bandlimited) amplitude of
 * the wave will be decreased such that the peak is always under 1.0.
 * This is probably not what you want unless you are using a constant
 * frequency value.
